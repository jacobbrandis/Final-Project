# Final-Project
This is the working progress of my Final Project

'''
Curious, Creative, Tenacious(requires hopefulness) and Perseverance

**********Gameplay ideas:
Make a bad powerup that will slow the players mobility and make their jump height less for 5 seconds.
Also make a way to go down steps by pressing s.

**********Cosmetics
New hazard that is a spikey guy. New background that is a pink color. New Player color. New platfrom color.
New title screen. New title text. New background music. New mushroom cosmetic.

**********Bugs
Small issue when falling into a spikey guy. It doesn't do anything sometimes, but for the most part, it will
make the player sprite shoot downward.

**********Features
Added new hazard. New cosmetics. New falling feature when pressing s. New background music. New mushroom cosmetic.


Personal Note:
I had a fun time coding this project. I had days where I made loads of progress, but I also had
days where I was stuck on a single line of code. I have had a tremendous learning experience in this
class, and it will go doen in the list of one of my favorites. My game works, but there are a few things
that would make it better, if I knew more about Pygame. To conclude, I had a great time working on this,
and I hope you enjoy my game.
